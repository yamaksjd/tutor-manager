### Project Title
**Tutor Manager**

### Description
A management system designed to support a local tutoring center by streamlining scheduling, student tracking, and general administrative tasks.

### Motivation
I started this project after realizing how overwhelmed the manager at my tutoring center was with organizing schedules, managing students, and keeping track of everything manually. I saw inefficiencies in the current system and wanted to build a simple, helpful solution to support her work.

### Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Firebase

### Status
Currently in development — finalizing essential features and integrating Firebase. UI will be translated into Portuguese and deployed by mid-2025.
